      <p>Based on the above goals, I then identified a list of features that my application must have in order to successfully meet these key aims: </p>
      <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>

      <h4>Application Requirements</h4>
      <p><ul>
        <li>Provide an intuitive user interface</li>
        <li>Produce a Swift application that's compatible with the current range of iOS devices</li>
        <li>Base my user interface on the SwiftUI framework</li>
        <li>Ensure my user interface integrates well with the OS</li>
       </ul></p>

      <h4>Essential Image Processing Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Exposure</li>
        <li>Contrast</li>
        <li>Cropping</li>
        <li>Greyscale</li>
        <li>Brightness</li>
      </ul>
      <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
      <h4>Advanced Image Processing Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Noise Reduction</li>
        <li>Spot Healing</li>
        <li>Graduated Filter</li>
        <li>Saturation</li>

          <p>As part of the planning process, I:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Produced a formal project plan</li>
              <li>Undertook a literature survey to research the state-of-the-art for various techniques</li>
              <li>Produced a project schedule in the form of a Gantt chart</li>
              <li>Produced initial drafts of the algorithms</li>
              <li>Produced a series of iterative user interface drafts:</li>

                <p>This draft introduces the gamification elements in the application, as well featuring a heavily text-based home screen and tutorial screen featuring multiple information panes.</p>

                <p>The homescreen was changed to a more graphics-based layout, the tutorial interface divided into separate content and practice areas, and user profiling capability added.</p>

        <div class = row>
          <p>As I'd never coded in Swift or CIKernel before, I first began by learning the basics of both languages and identifying which areas I'd need to be proficient in to complete the project successfully. Once I was comfortable in using both, I began to build my implementation and gradually add the features specified in the plan.</p>
          <p>During development, I met with my supervisor each week to review progress and identify what I should do next. These meetings also allowed me to get opinions on new ideas I had for the project during development, such as adding cloud synchronisation. I completed development as per my development schedule, with all of the pre-determined abilities present as well as some new ones added along the way.</p>
