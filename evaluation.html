      <h2>How I'm Evaluating the Project</h2>
      <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
    <p>Evaluation was performed via ’user testing’, where the testing of the solution is performed by real members of the target audience who are able to use the application themselves and reach their own conclusions.</p>
    <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
    <p>The process was performed as follows:</p>
      
    <ol>
      <li>Each potential evaluation candidate was asked whether or not they wish to participate</li>
      <li>The candidates were asked to complete a pre-session questionnaire designed to gauge their current mobile device and image-editing experience, as well their enthusiasm for bolstering their image-editing skills. </li>
      <li>They are asked to independently complete a series of tasks, using the application, designed to cover the entirety of the user interface and functionality.</li>
      <li>A post-session questionnaire is completed designed to gauge their opinion of the application.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
    <p>Ordinarily, this process would take place in person. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic meant that the evaluation method had to be adapted to remove any in-person contact. Ergo, the following changes were made:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluation instructions and consent forms were delivered to each candidate digitally</li>
      <li>The evaluation took place over video-conferencing software</li>
      <li>The pre- and post- questionnaire form questions were asked, with the candidate's answer being recorded by me</li>
      <li>Instead of using the application hands-on, the candidate was able to see a live view of the application via the video conferencing software.</li>
      <li>In order to complete the series of tasks using the application, the candidate instead was asked to guide me through their thought-process for each task step-by-step.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>

    <p>Evaluation participants were assigned to one of two user-groups:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Users with limited photo-editing experience but good mobiledevice experience</li>
      <li>Users with both limited photo-editing and mobile device experience.</li>
     </ol>

      <h2>Evaluation Results</h2>
      <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
      <p>The results of the evaluation were overwhelmingly positive. Users cited the simple interface, wide range of tutorials, intuitive editing tools and the guided learning process as the main strengths of the application. During the interactive evaluation session, users were all able to complete the tutorials with ease and navigate the interface successfully.</p>
    <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
    <p>Overall, users rated the application (on average) 8.6 out of a possible 10. The range of scores was between 6 and 10, with the mode score being 9.</p>

      <h2>Subsequent Improvements</h2>
      <div class = "spacing-ctsmall"></div>
      <p>As a result of the evaluation process, several areas of improvement for the application were highlighted. Ergo, the following changes were enacted:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The ability for a user to import their own photo to be edited was added</li>
        <li>The 'Erase All Progress and Favourites' button was relocated to the user profile page, making it easier to find; it was previously in the 'edit profile' page</li>
        <li>A section as added to the help area detailing the tutorial unlocking mechanism.</li>
        <li>A tutorial featuring all edits was added</li>
      </ul>
